# Assignment: Python NumPy Library

This repository contains my Python notebook and an utility script file, demonstrating the array manipulations capabilities of the NumPy library.

Notebook

The solutions are provided in a single Google Colab notebook Assignment_02_Velayutham_Augustheesan_NumPy.ipynb along with the input_utils.py file.

## Description

The notebook contains Python programs for the following tasks:

* Generate a uniform subdivision of an interval.
* Create an array of length 3n with the cyclic pattern 1, 2, 3.
* Create an array of the first n odd integers (user input n).
* Create an 8x8 array with a checkerboard pattern of zeros and ones.
* Create an array x with 100 uniformly spaced points in \[-1,1] and compute y = x**2 \* sin(x**2) + x.
* Plot y vs x using Matplotlib.
* Define a function to create an n×n array with (i,j)-entry equal to i+j.
* Generate a random 3×5 array using `np.random.rand(3,5)` and compute:

  * sum of all entries
  * sum of rows
  * sum of columns
* Demonstrate usage of the utility function `get_positive_integer` from `input_utils.py` for validated user input.

Each task includes input validation, clear function definitions, and example outputs.

## Usage

* Download both the notebook (`python_utilities_velayutham_augustheesan.ipynb`) and `input_utils.py` into the same directory.
* Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
* Run each cell sequentially to see the outputs.
* The notebook already contains the necessary imports for using `input_utils.py`.
