## Description

This notebook contains solutions to the first assignment for **Basic Python Programming**. The problems focus on fundamental Python concepts including:

- Data types and type validation
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and modular programming
- List, dictionary, and string manipulations
- Use of Python built-in modules (`collections`, `heapq`, `math`, `re`)
- Error handling and input validation

Each problem is implemented as a function with clear docstrings, type hints, and inline comments. Test cases are included to validate the correctness of the functions.
