# Python Assignment Solutions

This repository contains solutions to a set of Python programming problems. The solutions are implemented in a **Google Colab notebook** and cover a variety of topics including data structures, string manipulation, math problems, and algorithmic exercises.

## Contents

- `assignment_solutions.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook containing all problem solutions, explanations, and example runs.

## Problem Topics Covered

1. String manipulation and analysis  
   - Checking anagrams  
   - Reversing words in a sentence  
   - Counting vowels and word frequencies  

2. List and number operations  
   - Rotating a list  
   - Finding the second largest number  
   - Merging sorted lists  
   - Generating Pascal’s Triangle  

3. Math and algorithmic problems  
   - Prime numbers  
   - Other utility functions  

Each problem is implemented as a separate function with proper input validation, documentation, and example usage.

## How to Use
